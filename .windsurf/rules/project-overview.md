This is an Angular 19 Project.
We will use Standalone components by default, with SCSS styling.

We can use angularprimitives to leverage more complex components out of the box, like dialogs, toggles, or other UI elements.

The application is an SPA video game based on the basic Drug Wars game where you buys and sell drugs.
